
Welcome to D-Rats compiled for Windows XP. Windows7 and Windows 10

To use this version just unrar it into a folder of your choice and launch d-rats.exe
it will create its own data folder in parallel to the own created by former d-Rats 0.3.3 install, so not to interfere 
please report any success or failure to iz2lxi@yahoo.it
