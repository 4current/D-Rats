the D-Rats stores its configuration in the user home folder
 - on linux this is here: 
 	/home/users/ [USERNAME] / ...

 - on windows this is here:
	C:\Users\ [USERNAME] \AppData\Roaming\D-RATS

*** errors in Files tab 

if you happen to see "strange" files appearing into the files tabs, togeher with un-working d-rats, 
then this is most probably happening because of a bad order in the PATH variable of your windows pc.

i.e. have you put the aspell path at the beginning of the PATH insted of at its end?

 
**** Path variable ****
It seems that nasty things happen if you dont have the right order in the path variable. 
especially if you install locall Python and the various libraries, you will easily end up in with a malfunctioning system
