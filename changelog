fixed look and feel issue adding the entire glade folder to the distributed version

First alpha of version 3.3.4 released

issues:
- lack of installer

Notes:
- at first launch it will create its own config dir into the D-RATS-EV folder (asido to the original D-, RATS so it should not interfere with existing installations
- the folder for maps is now suited to host more than one map. actually there is the openstreetmap and the opencycle maps

Removed d-Rats Map-downloader and started simplifing the mapdisplay module code 
NOTE: The D-Rats Mapdownloader application has been discontinued -- please use one 
of the exisitng opensource tools to download the maps tiles to use offline in D-Rats .

You can use JTileDownloader
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/JTileDownloader

The map site URL are:

         Base map:     Openstreetmap
         cycle map:    OpenCycleMap

When downloaded just move the tile folders under the right map folder in D.Rats, e.g:

         Base map:     C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\D-RATS\maps\base
         Cycle map:    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\D-RATS\maps\cycle
